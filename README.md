# CBusPASSAddIn

CBUS PASS Add-in was a part of a presentation done at the Columbus SQL PASS user group meeting in Feb-2015.

The presentation (located here on Microsoft SWAY https://sway.com/m55RT91I8WpPeKRs) discussed opportunities to increase shared responsibility in a self-service environment.

The toolbar here is an example that will connect to a local database instance, read and update a table and execute a job.

Written in C#, it's an example of extending tools that data professionals already use (SQL Server) into the hands of users through tools they already use (Excel), but still being able to maintain control and oversight of those processes.
